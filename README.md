## Motivation

There are so many commands in Linux platform, and most of the commands   
have the bulk of features that scares people away. In fact, many commands are   
functionally redundant, and many features you rarely use (maybe you never use).  
So just remembering the most useful commands and features, it will help you solve    
99% of the problems, the remaining 1% why not [Google]?
